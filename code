      "Rewritten Text: ## The Triumph of Nuns in Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent surge in media portrayals of nuns, from the Oscar-nominated \"Philomena\" to the popular TV series \"Call the Midwife,\" has sparked a conversation about the representation of religious women in literature. While the prevalence of nuns in books may seem disproportionate to their actual presence in the real world, it's a story that resonates with many.\n",
      "\n",
      "The popularity of these fictionalized accounts is not merely anecdotal. It points to a deeper truth: the power of storytelling to bridge the gap between reality and imagination. These narratives offer a glimpse into the lives of women who chose to dedicate themselves to service and spirituality.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to acknowledge that the vast majority of nuns in books are written by women authors. This bias reflects the historical reality that women have been the primary chroniclers of religious experiences. However, it also highlights the need for more diverse voices within the literary landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the limitations, the presence of nuns in literature has a positive impact. It challenges stereotypes, provides role models for young girls, and offers a platform to explore themes of faith, compassion, and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the surge in fictionalized narratives about nuns is a testament to the power of storytelling and its ability to illuminate the human experience. While the representation of nuns in books may be disproportionate to their actual presence in the real world, it's a triumph of imagination and empathy. It's a story that reminds us of the profound impact that women of faith can have on the world. \n",

The majority of new-born males in the country undergo circumcision as part of religious rituals in Judaism and Islam, while Christian Israelis follow societal norms that emphasize cleanliness and hygiene as reasons for circumcision. While complications from infant circumcision in Israel are relatively rare, they do occur.
